# HexMem Sync Hook

Integrates Clawdbot sessions with HexMem structured memory.

## What It Does

### On Session Start (`command:new`)
- Searches HexMem for memories relevant to the new session context
- Could inject relevant context into the session (future)

### On Session End (`command:reset`, `command:stop`)
- Parses the session transcript for extractable observations
- Queues observations for embedding in HexMem
- Logs session summary as an event

## Requirements

- Python 3 with HexMem dependencies installed
- HexMem database at `~/clawd/hexmem/hexmem.db`
- HexMem venv at `~/clawd/hexmem/.venv`

## Configuration

Set `HEXMEM_DB` environment variable to override database location.

## Extracted Patterns

The hook looks for:
- **Preferences**: "I prefer...", "I like...", "I always...", "I never..."
- **Decisions**: "I'll...", "Let's...", "We should..."
- **Learnings**: Tool outputs, error resolutions
- **Facts**: Explicit statements about entities

## Notes

This hook saves observations to the embedding queue, which must be processed
separately with `python embed.py --process-queue`.
