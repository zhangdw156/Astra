## Tuning Workflow Guide

Your AI follows a proven tuning sequence:

### Phase 1: Base Setup
```
You: "I'm setting up a new MS3 for my 5.0L V8"

AI: [Guides through required fuel calculation]
AI: [Helps calibrate sensors]
AI: [Verifies base timing]
```

### Phase 2: Idle & Startup
```
You: "I need to get it idling properly"

AI: [Sets cranking pulse widths]
AI: [Tunes VE at idle cells]
AI: [Adjusts idle advance]
AI: [Configures idle valve control]
```

### Phase 3: Light Load & Cruise
```
You: "Time to tune cruise and part throttle"

AI: [Sets AFR targets for economy]
AI: [Tunes VE in 1500-3000 RPM range]
AI: [Adjusts accel enrichment]
AI: [Verifies closed-loop EGO correction]
```

### Phase 4: Power Tuning
```
You: "Ready to tune WOT"

AI: [Sets rich AFR targets for power]
AI: [Tunes high-load VE cells]
AI: [Conservative ignition timing first]
AI: [Advances timing for power]
```

### Reviewing a Tune File
```
You: "Check this MSQ file for any safety issues before I start my engine"

AI: [Analyzes VE table, AFR targets, ignition timing, safety limits]

AI: "Found 1 critical issue: No rev limiter configured. 
     2 warnings: VE table has values below 20 (likely untuned cells).
     Recommend setting rev limiter before first start."
```

### Tune Critique for Optimization
```
You: "Review my tune and suggest improvements"

AI: [Checks injector duty cycle, timing conservatism, AFR targets]

AI: "Suggestions:
     1. Injector duty at WOT is ~75% - good headroom
     2. Timing in cruise cells is conservative (25°) - could add 3-5° for economy
     3. VE table has a 40% jump between 3000/60kPa and 3200/60kPa - smooth this"
```

## Safety First: Tuning Principles

Your AI agent emphasizes safe tuning practices:

### 🔍 **Verify Before Trusting**
- Always verify base timing with a light first
- Calibrate sensors before tuning
- Start rich and lean out gradually
- Add timing slowly, listening for knock

### 👁️ **Monitor Critical Parameters**
- Watch AFR on every WOT pull
- Monitor EGT if available
- Keep injector duty cycle under 85%
- Watch for EGO correction maxing out

### ✅ **Save Often**
Your AI reminds you to:
- Save tune before major changes
- Use descriptive names with dates
- Keep a known-good backup
- Document what each version changed

### 📋 **Safety Limits**
Your AI warns about:
- Lean AFR at WOT (>14.0:1 dangerous)
- Excessive timing advance (knock risk)
- Overheating (coolant >100°C)
- Overboost conditions

## Common Tuning Scenarios

### Starting from Scratch
```
You: "I just installed Megasquirt, where do I start?"

AI: "Let's go through the base configuration first:
1. What's your engine displacement?
2. Injector flow rate?
3. What firmware version?"

[Guides through each step]
```

### Fixing Driveability Issues
```
You: "It stumbles when I hit the gas"

AI: "That's typically lean tip-in. Let's check:
1. Your current accel enrichment settings
2. TPS calibration
3. May need more enrichment or faster decay"

[Walks through diagnosis and fix]
```

### Adding Boost
```
You: "I'm adding a turbo, what needs to change?"

AI: "Several things to update:
1. Lower AFR targets under boost (11.5-12.5)
2. Retard timing in boost cells
3. Add overboost protection
4. Consider larger injectors"

[Full boost tuning guide]
```

### Troubleshooting a Problem
```
You: "My AFR is 16:1 at 3000 RPM cruise"

AI: "That's lean. Let's diagnose:
1. Is EGO correction high positive?
2. Check VE table at that RPM/MAP
3. Verify fuel pressure
4. Could be a vacuum leak"

[Systematic troubleshooting]
```

## Tips for Best Results

### Be Specific About Your Setup
- ✅ "2.0L turbo 4-cylinder, 880cc injectors, MS3"
- ❌ "My car" (too vague)

### Provide Context
- ✅ "It runs fine cold but gets lean when hot"
- ✅ "Detonation at 4000 RPM only under full boost"
- ❌ "It doesn't run right"

### Share Your Current Settings
- "My VE at 3000/80kPa is 75"
- "Running 20° advance at that cell"
- "AEM wideband reading 12.0 AFR"

### Iterate Safely
- You: "Add 2° timing"
- AI: [Explains the risk, suggests testing]
- You: "Tested, no knock, can we add more?"
- AI: [Guides further advance]

## What NOT to Do

Your AI won't encourage:
- ❌ Blindly copying someone else's tune
- ❌ Skipping base timing verification
- ❌ Making large VE changes without logging
- ❌ Ignoring knock or high EGT warnings
- ❌ Tuning WOT before idle is stable

## Reference Materials

Your AI has access to:
- Complete TunerStudio interface guide
- Megasquirt tuning procedures
- Required fuel equations
- AFR target recommendations
- Troubleshooting flows

Just ask:
- "What's the formula for required fuel?"

- "What should my warmup enrichment curve look like?"

## Troubleshooting

**"It won't start"**
- Check: Cranking PW, spark during cranking, fuel pressure, base timing

**"Runs but won't idle"**
- Check: Vacuum leaks, TPS calibration, idle valve function, minimum airflow

**"Lean at WOT"**
- Check: VE table, fuel pressure under load, injector duty cycle

**"Knock under load"**
- Check: Timing advance, AFR (too lean), fuel octane, IAT (hot intake)

**"Hesitation on tip-in"**
- Check: Accel enrichment, TPSdot threshold, MAP response

**"EGO correction always high"**
- Check: VE table accuracy, sensor calibration, fuel pressure

## Need Help?

Just ask your AI:
- "Walk me through tuning my VE table"
