# ClawBack

**Mirror congressional stock trades with automated broker execution**

## Agent Instructions

When the user invokes `/clawback`, execute the appropriate command based on the argument:

### Commands

When the user invokes `/clawback` with any arguments, execute the corresponding command:

| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `/clawback setup` | Run the setup wizard: Execute `{baseDir}/bin/clawback.py setup` |
| `/clawback status` | Check system status: Execute `{baseDir}/bin/clawback.py status` |
| `/clawback run` | Start trading bot: Execute `{baseDir}/bin/clawback.py run` |
| `/clawback daemon` | Run as background service: Execute `{baseDir}/bin/clawback.py daemon` |
| `/clawback test` | Test notifications: Execute `{baseDir}/bin/clawback.py test` |
| `/clawback` (no args) | Show help: Execute `{baseDir}/bin/clawback.py --help` |

### How to Execute Commands

**Option 1: Using the wrapper script (recommended)**
When executing ClawBack commands, always:
1. Use the wrapper script at `{baseDir}/bin/clawback.py`
2. Pass the command as an argument (e.g., `{baseDir}/bin/clawback.py status`)
3. Capture and display the output to the user

**Option 2: Direct Python execution (if wrapper doesn't work)**
If the wrapper script fails, you can run ClawBack directly:
1. Change to the skill directory: `cd {baseDir}`
2. Activate the virtual environment: `source venv/bin/activate`
3. Run the CLI: `python -m clawback.cli [command]`
4. Capture and display the output

**Important**: Always check if the virtual environment exists at `{baseDir}/venv`. If not, you may need to run the setup first.

### `/clawback setup` - Interactive Setup Flow

When user runs `/clawback setup`, follow these steps:

**Step 1: Install dependencies (if needed)**
Check if `{baseDir}/venv` exists. If not, run:
```bash
cd {baseDir} && python3 -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate && pip install -e .
```

**Step 2: Prompt for E*TRADE credentials**
Ask the user for each value:

1. **Environment**: Ask "Do you want to use **sandbox** (testing) or **production** (real money)?"
   - Default: sandbox

2. **Consumer Key**: Ask "Enter your E*TRADE Consumer Key (from developer.etrade.com):"
   - Required field

3. **Consumer Secret**: Ask "Enter your E*TRADE Consumer Secret:"
   - Required field

4. **Account ID**: Ask "Enter your E*TRADE Account ID (or leave blank to get it after OAuth):"
   - Optional - can be obtained later

**Step 3: Save configuration**
Create/update `~/.clawback/config.json` with the provided values:
```json
{
  "broker": {
    "adapter": "etrade",
    "environment": "<sandbox or production>",
    "credentials": {
      "apiKey": "<consumer_key>",
      "apiSecret": "<consumer_secret>"
    }
  },
  "trading": {
    "accountId": "<account_id>",
    "initialCapital": 50000,
    "tradeScalePercentage": 0.01,
    "maxPositionPercentage": 0.05,
    "dailyLossLimit": 0.02
  },
  "notifications": {
    "telegram": {
      "enabled": true,
      "useOpenClaw": true
    }
  },
  "congress": {
    "dataSource": "official",
    "pollIntervalHours": 24,
    "minimumTradeSize": 10000
  }
}
```

**Step 4: Confirm setup**
Tell the user: "Configuration saved to ~/.clawback/config.json. Run `/clawback status` to verify."

### Getting E*TRADE API Credentials

Direct user to: https://developer.etrade.com
1. Create a developer account
2. Create a new app (sandbox first for testing)
3. Copy the Consumer Key and Consumer Secret

### Configuration Location

- Config file: `~/.clawback/config.json`
- Skill directory: `{baseDir}`

### Reading Saved Configuration

To check if the user has configured credentials, read `~/.clawback/config.json`:
- If file doesn't exist or credentials are empty → prompt for setup
- If credentials exist → can proceed with status/run commands

The CLI automatically reads from `~/.clawback/config.json` for all operations.

### Checking Setup Status

Before running `/clawback status` or `/clawback run`, verify:
1. `{baseDir}/venv` exists (dependencies installed)
2. `~/.clawback/config.json` exists with non-empty `broker.credentials.apiKey`

If either is missing, suggest running `/clawback setup` first.

ClawBack tracks stock trades disclosed by members of Congress (House and Senate) and executes scaled positions in your E*TRADE brokerage account. Built on the premise that congressional leaders consistently outperform the market due to informational advantages.

## Default Target Politicians

ClawBack monitors these politicians by default (configurable):

| Politician | Chamber | Priority |
|------------|---------|----------|
| Nancy Pelosi | House | 1 (highest) |
| Dan Crenshaw | House | 2 |
| Tommy Tuberville | Senate | 2 |
| Marjorie Taylor Greene | House | 3 |

## Trading Strategy Defaults

| Parameter | Default | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| Trade Delay | 3 days | Wait after disclosure before trading |
| Holding Period | 30 days | Target hold time for positions |
| Position Size | 5% | Max allocation per trade |
| Stop-Loss | 8% | Per-position stop-loss |
| Portfolio Drawdown | 15% | Max portfolio loss before halt |
| Disclosure Checks | 10:00, 14:00, 18:00 ET | Daily check times |

## Features

- **Real-time disclosure tracking** from official House Clerk and Senate eFD sources
- **Automated trade execution** via E*TRADE API (only supported broker)
- **Smart position sizing** - scales trades to your account size
- **Trailing stop-losses** - lock in profits, limit losses
- **Risk management** - drawdown limits, consecutive loss protection
- **Telegram notifications** - get alerts for new trades and stop-losses
- **Backtesting engine** - test strategies on historical data

## Performance (Backtest Results)

| Strategy | Win Rate | Return | Sharpe |
|----------|----------|--------|--------|
| 3-day delay, 30-day hold | 42.9% | +6.2% | 0.39 |
| 9-day delay, 90-day hold | 57.1% | +4.7% | 0.22 |

Congressional leaders have outperformed the S&P 500 by 47% annually according to NBER research.

## Installation via ClawHub

```bash
# Install from ClawHub registry
clawhub install clawback

# Or install from local directory
clawhub install ./clawback
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Skill not executing**: If `/clawback` doesn't work in OpenClaw:
   - Check if the skill is in the correct location: `{baseDir}/`
   - Verify the wrapper script is executable: `chmod +x {baseDir}/bin/clawback.py`
   - Check if virtual environment exists: `{baseDir}/venv/`

2. **Authentication issues**: If E*TRADE authentication fails:
   - Run the authentication utility: `python {baseDir}/scripts/auth_utility.py --auth`
   - Run `{baseDir}/bin/clawback.py setup` to reconfigure
   - Check credentials in `~/.clawback/config.json`
   - Verify E*TRADE API keys are valid

3. **Token expiration**: If tokens expire (30-day lifespan):
   - Run: `python {baseDir}/scripts/auth_utility.py --refresh`
   - Or start new authentication: `python {baseDir}/scripts/auth_utility.py --auth`

4. **Python import errors**: If you see "ModuleNotFoundError":
   - Ensure virtual environment is activated
   - Run `pip install -e .` in `{baseDir}/`
   - Check Python path includes `{baseDir}/src`

### Debug Mode

To debug skill execution, add `DEBUG=1` environment variable:
```bash
DEBUG=1 {baseDir}/bin/clawback.py status
```

This will show additional information about the execution context.

### Post-Installation Setup

After installation via ClawHub, the `install.sh` script runs automatically:

1. **Python Environment Setup** - Creates virtual environment
2. **Package Installation** - Installs ClawBack via pip
3. **Directory Structure** - Creates logs/, data/, config/ directories
4. **Setup Prompt** - Asks if you want to run the setup wizard

If you skip setup during installation, run it manually:
```bash
cd ~/.openclaw/skills/clawback
./setup.sh          # Interactive setup wizard
# or
clawback setup      # CLI-based setup
```

### Improved Setup Features

- **Better input handling** - Works in both interactive and non-interactive modes
- **Input validation** - Validates E*TRADE API key formats
- **Timeout handling** - Automatically uses defaults if no input
- **Error recovery** - Fallback to manual setup if CLI fails
- **Configuration check** - Detects existing config and offers options

## Interactive Setup Wizard

The setup wizard guides you through configuration:

### Step 1: Environment Selection
- **Sandbox** (recommended for testing): No real trades, uses E*TRADE developer sandbox
- **Production**: Real trading with real money

### Step 2: E*TRADE API Credentials
- **Consumer Key**: From E*TRADE developer portal
- **Consumer Secret**: From E*TRADE developer portal

### Step 3: Authentication
- Automatic OAuth flow with E*TRADE
- Opens browser for authorization
- Returns verification code

### Step 4: Account Selection
- Lists all available E*TRADE accounts
- Choose which account to trade with

### Step 5: Telegram Setup (Optional)
- Configure notifications via Telegram bot
- Uses OpenClaw's built-in Telegram channel if available

## Environment Variables

After setup, credentials are stored in `.env`:

```bash
# E*TRADE API (required)
BROKER_API_KEY=your_consumer_key_here
BROKER_API_SECRET=your_consumer_secret_here
BROKER_ACCOUNT_ID=your_account_id_here

# Telegram (optional)
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=your_bot_token_here
TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID=your_chat_id_here

# FMP API (optional)
FMP_API_KEY=your_fmp_api_key_here
```

## Usage

```bash
# Use the installed CLI command
clawback run      # Start interactive trading mode
clawback daemon   # Run as background service
clawback status   # Check system status
clawback setup    # Re-run setup wizard
clawback test     # Test Telegram notifications
```

## Automated Trading

The `clawback daemon` command runs continuously with:
- **Disclosure checks** at 10:00, 14:00, 18:00 ET (when filings are typically released)
- **Trade execution** at 9:35 AM ET (5 min after market open)
- **Token refresh** every 90 minutes (keeps E*TRADE session alive)
- **Market hours enforcement** (9:30 AM - 4:00 PM ET)

## Data Sources

- **House Clerk**: https://disclosures-clerk.house.gov (PDF parsing)
- **Senate eFD**: https://efdsearch.senate.gov (web scraping)
- **Financial Modeling Prep**: Enhanced financial data (optional)

## Supported Brokers

ClawBack currently only supports E*TRADE. The adapter pattern allows for future broker support, but only E*TRADE is implemented and tested.

| Broker | Adapter | Status |
|--------|---------|--------|
| E*TRADE | `etrade_adapter.py` | Supported |

## Risk Management

- **Position limits**: 5% max per symbol, 20 positions max
- **Stop-losses**: 8% per position, 15% portfolio drawdown
- **Daily limits**: 3% max daily loss
- **PDT compliance**: Conservative 2 trades/day limit

## Authentication Helpers

For manual E*TRADE authentication outside the main CLI:

```bash
# Standalone OAuth authentication script
cd {baseDir}
source venv/bin/activate
python scripts/auth_script.py
```

This generates an authorization URL, prompts for the verification code, and completes authentication.

## File Locations

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `~/.clawback/config.json` | Main configuration |
| `~/.clawback/.access_tokens.json` | E*TRADE OAuth tokens |
| `~/.clawback/data/trading.db` | SQLite database |

## Security

- No hardcoded credentials in source code
- Environment variable based configuration
- Encrypted token storage for E*TRADE
- Git-ignored `.env` file
- Optional production encryption
