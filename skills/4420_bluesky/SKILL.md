# Bluesky CLI

Full-featured CLI for Bluesky/AT Protocol.

## Agent Instructions

**First: Check if logged in**
```bash
bsky whoami
```

- If shows handle → ready to use commands below
- If "Not logged in" → guide user through Setup section

**Common tasks:**
- "Post to Bluesky" → `bsky post "text"`
- "Check my timeline" → `bsky timeline`
- "Like this post" → `bsky like <url>`
- "Follow someone" → `bsky follow @handle`

## Setup

If user isn't logged in (`bsky whoami` shows "Not logged in"), guide them through setup:

### Getting an App Password

Tell the user:
> Go to bsky.app → click your avatar → Settings → Privacy and Security → App Passwords → Add App Password. Name it "OpenClaw" and copy the password (like `xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx`). You'll only see it once!

### Logging In

Once they have the app password, run:
```bash
bsky login --handle THEIR_HANDLE.bsky.social --password THEIR_APP_PASSWORD
```

Example:
```bash
bsky login --handle alice.bsky.social --password abcd-1234-efgh-5678
```

**Security:** Password is used once to get a session token, then immediately discarded. Never stored on disk. Session auto-refreshes.

## Error Handling

| Error | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| "Session expired" | Run `bsky login` again |
| "Not logged in" | Run `bsky login --handle ... --password ...` |
| "Post is X chars (max 300)" | Shorten text |
| "Image too large" | Use image under 1MB |

## Notes

- All `<url>` parameters accept either `https://bsky.app/...` URLs or `at://` URIs
- Handles auto-append `.bsky.social` if no domain specified
- Image posts require `--alt` for accessibility (Bluesky requirement)
- Session tokens auto-refresh; password never stored
