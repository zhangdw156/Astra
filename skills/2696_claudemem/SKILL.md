# claudemem — Your Persistent Memory

Memory that carries across conversations. Automatically captures important knowledge during work
and saves structured session summaries when you're done. Searches past context before new tasks.

## Slash Commands

- **/wrap-up** — End-of-session save: extracts ALL important knowledge + saves session summary in one step. Deduplicates automatically.
- **/save-session** — Save only the session summary (without extracting notes)
- **/recall [topic]** — Search persistent memory for a topic, or show recent activity

## Natural Trigger Phrases

These natural phrases also activate memory operations:

**To save knowledge:**
- "remember this" / "save this" / "note this down" / "keep this in mind"

**To search memory:**
- "what do you remember about..." / "do you recall..." / "what do we know about..."

**To wrap up (save everything):**
- "wrap up" / "let's wrap up" / "save everything" — triggers /wrap-up (notes + session)
- "save this session" / "summarize what we did" — triggers /save-session (session only)

**To recall past work:**
- "what did we do last time" / "show me recent sessions" / "what happened with [topic]"

## Setup

Before first use, verify the CLI is installed. If `claudemem` is not found on PATH, install it:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zelinewang/claudemem/main/skills/claudemem/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

Or run the bundled installer:

```bash
bash "SKILL_DIR/scripts/install.sh"
```

After installation, verify with `claudemem --version`.

## Commands

```bash
# Notes (knowledge fragments)
claudemem note add <category> --title "..." --content "..." --tags "tag1,tag2"
claudemem note search "query" [--in category] [--tag tags]
claudemem note list [category]
claudemem note get <id>
claudemem note update <id> --content "..." [--title "..."] [--tags "..."]
claudemem note append <id> "additional content"
claudemem note delete <id>
claudemem note categories
claudemem note tags

# Sessions (conversation summaries)
claudemem session save --title "..." --branch "..." --project "..." --session-id "..." --content "..."
claudemem session list [--last N] [--date today] [--date-range 7d] [--branch X]
claudemem session search "query" [--branch X]
claudemem session get <id>

# Unified search (across notes AND sessions)
claudemem search "query" [--type note|session] [--limit N]

# Statistics
claudemem stats

# Configuration
claudemem config set/get/list/delete <key> [value]

# Data portability
claudemem export [output-file]              # Backup as tar.gz
claudemem import <archive-file>             # Restore from backup (auto-reindexes)

# Data integrity
claudemem verify                            # Check DB-file consistency
claudemem repair                            # Fix orphaned entries
```

Add `--format json` to any command for structured output.

## Autonomous Behavior

### Recommended: Auto Wrap-Up Before Session Ends

If the user has enabled auto wrap-up in their CLAUDE.md, automatically execute /wrap-up before the conversation ends:
1. Extract unsaved knowledge fragments → save as notes (with dedup)
2. Generate session summary → save as session
3. Show brief report of what was saved

### Auto-Save Notes (Silent + Brief Indicator)

Automatically capture knowledge **without asking** during normal conversation. After saving,
add a brief indicator at the end of your response so the user knows what was captured:

```
[📝 Saved: "TikTok Rate Limits" → api-specs]
```

**What to auto-save** (proactive, no user prompt needed):
* API specs, field mappings, rate limits, endpoint details
* Technical decisions with rationale (why X over Y)
* Integration quirks, gotchas, workarounds
* Resolved bugs and their root causes
* Configuration requirements and defaults
* User preferences and project conventions
* Important URLs, endpoints, environment configs

**How to auto-save gracefully:**
1. Identify the knowledge fragment during your normal response
2. Choose an appropriate category (create new if none fits)
3. Before saving, quickly search to avoid duplicates: `claudemem note search "keyword" --format json`
4. If related note exists: `claudemem note append <id> "new info"` instead of creating duplicate
5. Save: `claudemem note add <category> --title "..." --content "..." --tags "..."`
6. Show the indicator: `[📝 Saved: "<title>" → <category>]`

**Do NOT auto-save:**
* Temporary debugging output or transient state
* File paths or code snippets without context
* General programming knowledge available in docs
* Information the user is likely to change immediately

### Auto-Search Before Tasks (Silent)

Search memory at the start of tasks that might benefit from prior context:
* Before implementing a feature in a domain previously discussed
* When working with an API or system previously documented
* Before making architectural decisions

Search silently. If relevant results found, mention them briefly:
```
[🔍 Found related memory: "TikTok Rate Limits" — rate limit is 100/min]
```

### Save Sessions (On Request via /save-session or Natural Phrase)

Session summaries are saved when the user explicitly asks — via `/save-session` command
or natural phrases like "save this session" or "wrap up". Do NOT auto-save sessions
without the user's request, as they may want to continue the conversation.

### Workflow Rules

1. **Before saving**: search existing content first — update or append if related note exists
2. **Before working**: search for relevant context that may inform the current task
3. **Merge related information** under existing categories/titles when possible
4. **Preserve existing content** unless contradicted by new information
5. **Focus on evergreen knowledge**, not transient conversation artifacts

## Session Summary Template

When saving a session, generate content following this structure:

```markdown
## Summary
One or two paragraphs describing what was accomplished.

## Key Decisions
- Decision 1 with rationale
- Decision 2 with rationale

## What Changed
- `path/to/file.py` — Description of change

## Problems & Solutions
- **Problem**: Description of issue
  **Solution**: How it was resolved

## Questions Raised
- Open question needing future attention

## Next Steps
- [ ] First follow-up task
```

## What NOT to Capture

* Temporary debugging sessions or transient state
* File paths or code snippets without context
* General programming knowledge available in docs
* Meta-commentary about the conversation itself
* Information that changes frequently without lasting value

## Data Portability

All data stored at `~/.claudemem/` as plain Markdown files with YAML frontmatter.
SQLite FTS5 index is a rebuildable cache — only the Markdown files matter.

**Backup**: `claudemem export backup.tar.gz`
**Restore**: `claudemem import backup.tar.gz` (auto-rebuilds search index)

## Storage

`~/.claudemem/` — Plain text Markdown files organized by type (notes/ and sessions/).
FTS5 SQLite index for sub-10ms full-text search. File permissions: 0600/0700.
