```

### Option 2: Direct cURL

  -H "X-API-Key: $CREWAI_API_KEY" \
  -d '{"input": {...}}'
```

## Response Format

All crews return structured JSON:

```json

  "ok": true,
  "crew": "marketing",
  "trace_id": "abc123-def456",
  "result": {
    "workflow": "marketing",
    "output": "... the generated content ...",
    "input_summary": {...}
  },
  "error": null
}
```

**Extract the output:** The actual generated content is in `result.output`.

---

## Best Practices

1. **Set timeouts appropriately:**
   - Marketing/Support/Analysis: 30-60 seconds
   - Social Media: 5-10 minutes

2. **Check API key:** Ensure `CREWAI_API_KEY` environment variable is set or pass explicitly

3. **Handle errors:** Check the `error` field in responses

4. **Social Media crew:** Expect 3-5 minutes response time; don't interrupt

5. **Batch requests:** For multiple similar tasks, consider running them sequentially

---

## Health Check

Verify the CrewAI server is running:

```bash
curl https://crew.iclautomation.me/health
# Expected: {"ok": true}
```

---

## Future Expansion

When new crews are added to the server:
1. Update the "Available Crews" section
2. Add example usage to the helper script
3. Document input parameters and response times
