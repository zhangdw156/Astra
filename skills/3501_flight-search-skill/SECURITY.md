# 🔒 Security Policy

## ✅ Current Status: Production Ready

**All security issues identified during development have been resolved in v1.0.0.**

This skill has undergone comprehensive security auditing and all vulnerabilities have been fixed.

## 🛡️ Security Features

### **Input Validation**
- ✅ All user inputs are sanitized and validated
- ✅ No command injection vulnerabilities
- ✅ No Python code injection vulnerabilities
- ✅ Safe handling of special characters

### **Credential Protection**
- ✅ API keys stored in `config.json` (not in source code)
- ✅ `config.json` is in `.gitignore` by default
- ✅ `config.example.json` provided as template (no real keys)
- ✅ Credentials never logged or exposed in error messages

### **Network Security**
- ✅ HTTPS only for all API communications
- ✅ No cleartext transmission of sensitive data
- ✅ Proper timeout handling for network requests

### **Error Handling**
- ✅ Proper exit codes on errors (non-zero for failures)
- ✅ Clear error messages without exposing sensitive data
- ✅ Graceful handling of network/API failures
- ✅ Distinguishes between "not found" and actual errors

### **Configuration Validation**
- ✅ Validates config structure before use
- ✅ Checks for missing/empty API keys
- ✅ Friendly error messages for config issues
- ✅ No Python tracebacks on config errors

## 🔐 API Key Security

### **Amadeus API**
- **Required:** Yes (for flight search)
- **Free Tier:** 2,000 searches/month (sandbox), production also has free tier
- **Get Keys:** https://developers.amadeus.com
- **Storage:** `config.json` (not in git)

### **AviationStack API**
- **Required:** No (optional, for flight status only)
- **Free Tier:** 100 requests/month (very limited)
- **Get Keys:** https://aviationstack.com
- **Storage:** `config.json` (not in git)

## 📋 Security Checklist

Before using this skill in production:

- [ ] Copy `config.example.json` to `config.json`
- [ ] Add your Amadeus API credentials
- [ ] (Optional) Add AviationStack API credentials
- [ ] Verify `config.json` is in `.gitignore`
- [ ] Never commit `config.json` to version control
- [ ] Use production API keys for real prices (not sandbox)
- [ ] Review code if you have security concerns

## 🔍 Code Review

This skill is open source. We encourage security review:

- **Repository:** Check SKILL.md for links
- **Files:** All Python and Bash scripts are readable
- **No obfuscation:** All code is human-readable
- **No external dependencies:** Only standard Python libraries + requests

---

## 🚨 Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability:

1. **Do NOT** open a public issue
2. Email the maintainer directly
3. Include detailed reproduction steps
4. Allow time for response before disclosure

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This skill requires API keys from third-party services (Amadeus, AviationStack). 

- You are responsible for your API usage and costs
- Review the terms of service of each API provider
- Monitor your API usage to avoid unexpected charges
- This skill is provided "as is" without warranty

## 📚 Best Practices

1. **Start with Sandbox:** Test with Amadeus sandbox mode first
2. **Monitor Usage:** Track your API calls to stay within limits
3. **Rotate Keys:** Change API keys periodically
4. **Secure Storage:** Never commit `config.json` to git
5. **Review Code:** Always review code before running with API keys
