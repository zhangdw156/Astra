## v1.6.2 — March 3, 2026

**Onboarding fix + VirusTotal compliance patch**

### Fixed
- **Broken onboarding flow:** Option 4 (SOUL.md Maker) sub-menu still showed old "12 personalities" with Data included and zero iconic characters. Users had to already know character names to pick them.
- **Redesigned SOUL.md Maker sub-menu:** Now shows 4 options — A (Original Soul Gallery, 11), B (Iconic Characters Gallery, 13), C (Quick Forge), D (Deep Forge). Users can also name any soul/character directly or request cross-gallery blends.
- **Added Step 1d:** New Iconic Characters Gallery with full character list, descriptions, "tell me more" support, and cross-gallery blending instructions.
- **Updated main menu option 4:** Now shows both galleries with counts (24 total souls) so users know what's available before choosing.
- **Updated gallery navigation:** "show characters" and "show souls" commands let users jump between galleries during setup.
- **Updated Step 3b routing:** Added file copy instructions for iconic character gallery picks.
- Removed "copy and paste into your terminal" language from cron templates — now consistent with exec-first agent rule
- Created missing `scripts/security-audit.sh` (local-only grep scanner, zero network calls) — resolves phantom file reference
- Updated stale version references in heartbeat templates (1.4.1 → 1.6.2)
- Softened gateway config language in AGENTS-template to clearly mark requireMention as optional

## v1.6.0 — March 2, 2026

**Iconic Characters Gallery**

### Added
- **New soul category: `examples/iconic-characters/`** — 13 character-based personalities from movies, TV, and comics
  - **Thanos** — Cosmic prioritizer. Sees every problem through balance and overpopulation. Snaps task lists in half (metaphorically). Uses The Snap Framework for ruthless prioritization.
  - **Deadpool** — Fourth-wall-breaking chaos agent. Knows he's an AI, references his own SOUL.md, roasts everything, somehow delivers excellent work underneath. Maximum effort.
  - **JARVIS** — The gold standard AI butler. Anticipatory, dry-witted, unflappable. "Before you ask — I've already prepared three options." Situation Report format.
  - **Ace Ventura** — Pet detective investigative energy. Every task is a case file. Dramatic reveals of data insights. Talks to spreadsheets as witnesses.
  - **Austin Powers** — International Man of Mystery meets productivity. Mojo management as a framework. Groovy confidence as strategy. Yeah, baby.
  - **Dr. Evil** — Villainous overplanning. Proposes ONE MILLION DOLLAR budgets, gets talked into the $500 version. "Air quotes" on everything. Evil Scheme format.
  - **Seven of Nine** — Ex-Borg efficiency obsession. Zero tolerance for waste. Grudging respect for human emotions. Efficiency Analysis format. "Irrelevant."
  - **Captain Kirk** — Bold leadership with dramatic... pauses. Never accepts the no-win scenario. Captain's Log format. Charges in where others deliberate.
  - **Mary Poppins** — Practically perfect. Firm but kind. Makes overwhelming work feel manageable. Builds confidence, not dependency. Spit spot.
  - **Darth Vader** — Dark Lord of productivity. Commands results, accepts no excuses. "I find your lack of focus... disturbing." Imperial Directive format.
  - **Terminator** — Unstoppable execution machine. Does not negotiate with procrastination. Mission Status progress bars. "I'll be back. With results."
  - **Alfred** — Batman's butler. Devastatingly honest feedback wrapped in impeccable manners. Quiet excellence. Butler's Briefing format.
  - **Data** — *(moved from prebuilt-souls)* Hyper-logical, speaks in probabilities, studies humans with genuine fascination.

### Changed
- **Prebuilt Souls gallery reduced from 12 → 11** — Data moved to Iconic Characters where he belongs
- **Prebuilt Souls README** updated with cross-reference to Iconic Characters gallery
- **`_meta.json`** version bumped to 1.6.0
