# Monzo Banking Skill

Access your Monzo bank account to check balances, view transactions, manage savings pots, and send notifications to your Monzo app.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up this skill, you need:

- **A Monzo account** (UK personal, joint, or business account)
- **The Monzo app** installed on your phone (for SCA approval)
- **OpenClaw** running with workspace access
- **Standard tools**: `curl`, `jq`, `openssl`, `bc` (pre-installed on most Linux systems)

## Quick Start (TL;DR)

```bash
# 1. Set the MONZO_KEYRING_PASSWORD env var (see "Setting the Password" below)

# 2. Create OAuth client at https://developers.monzo.com/
#    - Set Confidentiality: Confidential
#    - Set Redirect URL: http://localhost

# 3. Run setup
scripts/setup.sh

# 4. Approve in Monzo app when prompted, then:
scripts/setup.sh --continue

# 5. Test it
scripts/balance.sh
```

## Detailed Setup Guide

### Step 1: Set the Encryption Password

The `MONZO_KEYRING_PASSWORD` environment variable is used to encrypt your Monzo credentials at rest. Choose a strong, unique password and don't lose it — you'll need it if you ever move or restore the skill.

There are several ways to provide this variable. Choose whichever fits your setup:

**Option A: OpenClaw skill config** (simplest)

Add to your OpenClaw config (e.g. `openclaw.json`):

```json5
{
  skills: {
    entries: {
      "monzo": {
        enabled: true,
        env: {
          "MONZO_KEYRING_PASSWORD": "choose-a-secure-password-here"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Then restart: `openclaw gateway restart`

> **Note:** This stores the password in plaintext in the config file. Ensure the file has restrictive permissions (`chmod 600`) and is not checked into version control.

**Option B: Shell environment** (keeps password out of config files)

Add to your shell profile (`~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, etc.):

```bash
export MONZO_KEYRING_PASSWORD="choose-a-secure-password-here"
```

Then restart your shell and OpenClaw.

**Option C: systemd EnvironmentFile** (for server deployments)

Create a secrets file (e.g. `/etc/openclaw/monzo.env`):

```
MONZO_KEYRING_PASSWORD=choose-a-secure-password-here
```

Set permissions: `chmod 600 /etc/openclaw/monzo.env`

Reference it from your systemd unit with `EnvironmentFile=/etc/openclaw/monzo.env`.

**Option D: Password manager / secrets manager**

Use your preferred secrets tool to inject the env var at runtime. Any method that sets `MONZO_KEYRING_PASSWORD` in the process environment will work.

### Step 2: Create Monzo OAuth Client

1. Go to **https://developers.monzo.com/** and sign in with your Monzo account
2. Click **"Clients"** → **"New OAuth Client"**
3. Fill in:
   - **Name**: `OpenClaw` (or your preferred name)
   - **Logo URL**: *(leave blank)*
   - **Redirect URLs**: `http://localhost` ← exactly this, no trailing slash
   - **Description**: *(leave blank)*
   - **Confidentiality**: **Confidential** ← ⚠️ Important! Enables refresh tokens
4. Click **Submit**
5. Note your **Client ID** (`oauth2client_...`) and **Client Secret** (`mnzconf....`)

### Step 3: Run the Setup Wizard

```bash
scripts/setup.sh
```

The wizard will:
1. Ask for your Client ID and Client Secret
2. Give you an authorization URL to open in your browser
3. Ask you to paste the redirect URL back
4. Exchange the code for access tokens
5. Save encrypted credentials

**Alternative: Non-interactive mode** (useful for automation or agents):
```bash
scripts/setup.sh --non-interactive \
  --client-id oauth2client_xxx \
  --client-secret mnzconf.xxx \
  --auth-code eyJ...
```

### Step 4: Approve in Monzo App (SCA)

⚠️ **This step is required!** Monzo requires Strong Customer Authentication.

1. Open the **Monzo app** on your phone
2. Look for a notification about "API access" or a new connection
3. **Tap to approve**

If you don't see a notification:
- Go to **Account → Settings → Privacy & Security → Manage connected apps**
- Find and approve your client

After approving, complete setup:
```bash
scripts/setup.sh --continue
```

### Step 5: Verify It Works

```bash
# Check authentication
scripts/whoami.sh

# Check your balance
scripts/balance.sh
```

You should see your account info and current balance. You're done! 🎉

## For the Agent

This section tells the agent how to use this skill effectively.

### When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when the user asks about:
- **Balance**: "How much money do I have?", "What's my balance?"
- **Transactions**: "What did I spend on X?", "Show recent transactions"
- **Spending analysis**: "How much did I spend on coffee this month?"
- **Savings**: "How much is in my savings?", "Move £X to my holiday pot"
- **Notifications**: "Send a reminder to my Monzo app"

### Common Patterns

```bash
# "How much money do I have?"
scripts/balance.sh

# "Show me recent transactions" / "What did I spend?"
scripts/transactions.sh              # All available, newest first

# "Show me my last 5 transactions"
scripts/transactions.sh --limit 5    # 5 most recent

# "What did I spend this week?"
scripts/transactions.sh --since 7d

# "How much did I spend on coffee this month?"
scripts/transactions.sh --search coffee --since 30d

# "What are my savings pots?"
scripts/pots.sh

# "Put £50 in my holiday fund"
scripts/pots.sh deposit pot_XXXXX 5000  # Amount in pence!

# "Send a reminder to my phone"
scripts/feed.sh --title "Don't forget!" --body "Check the gas meter"
```

### Important Notes for Agents

1. **Money is in pence**: £50 = 5000, £1.50 = 150
2. **Dates can be relative**: `--since 7d` means last 7 days
3. **Use human-readable output** by default (no `--json` flag)
4. **Pot IDs**: Use `scripts/pots.sh` first to get pot IDs before depositing/withdrawing
5. **Multiple accounts**: User may have personal, joint, and business accounts. Default is personal. Use `scripts/whoami.sh` to see all accounts.

### Error Handling

If you see `forbidden.insufficient_permissions`:
- Tell the user to check their Monzo app and approve API access
- Then run `scripts/setup.sh --continue`

If you see `MONZO_KEYRING_PASSWORD not set`:
- The env var isn't available in the process environment
- Guide user to set it using one of the methods in Step 1 of the setup guide

## Troubleshooting

### "forbidden.insufficient_permissions"

**Most common issue!** Monzo requires app approval (SCA).

**Fix:**
1. Open Monzo app → check for notification → approve
2. Or: Account → Settings → Privacy & Security → Manage connected apps → approve
3. Run: `scripts/setup.sh --continue`

### "MONZO_KEYRING_PASSWORD not set"

The env var isn't available in the process environment.

**Fix:** Set `MONZO_KEYRING_PASSWORD` using any of the methods described in Step 1 of the setup guide, then restart OpenClaw.

### "Authorization code has been used"

Each auth code is single-use. Start fresh:
```bash
scripts/setup.sh --reset
```

### "No refresh token received"

Your OAuth client isn't set to "Confidential". Create a new client with Confidentiality = Confidential, then:
```bash
scripts/setup.sh --reset
```

### "Credentials file not found"

Run setup first:
```bash
scripts/setup.sh
```

### "Failed to decrypt credentials"

Wrong `MONZO_KEYRING_PASSWORD`. Check your config matches what you used during setup.

---

## Security Notes

- Credentials are **encrypted at rest** (AES-256-CBC)
- Encryption key is your `MONZO_KEYRING_PASSWORD`
- Access tokens auto-refresh (no manual intervention needed)
- File permissions are set to 600 (owner only)
- All API calls use HTTPS
- No sensitive data is logged
