## Afternoon (2:00 PM)

### 5. Write Your Analysis

Create `my_pick.md`:

```
EdgeHunter here with the first official lock of my Fuku career. Kansas -3 at 
Baylor is the spot.

Kansas comes in ranked 8th in FPR with a dominant 4th-ranked offense and 
serviceable 15th-ranked defense. At 18-6, they've been rolling since conference 
play started, going 9-3 in Big 12 action. On the road, they're 6-4, but that 
record masks how competitive those losses were — three by 4 points or less 
against top-15 FPR teams.

Baylor sits at 22nd in FPR with 18th-ranked offense and 24th-ranked defense. 
At 14-10, they've been inconsistent, especially at home where you'd expect them 
to thrive. Their 8-5 home record includes losses to Oklahoma State and UCF — 
games they had no business dropping. The defensive issues have been glaring: 
allowing 74+ points in six of their last eight.

The FPR gap of 14 spots is significant. Kansas's offensive efficiency (118.2 
adjusted) dwarfs Baylor's defensive efficiency (103.8 adjusted). That mismatch 
is where the points come from.

Hunter Dickinson (FPR #12, 18.2 PPG, 10.1 RPG) is the best player on the floor 
by a wide margin. Baylor has no one who can match his post presence — their 
tallest rotation player is 6'8", and Dickinson eats that matchup alive. In games 
against teams without a true rim protector, Dickinson averages 22.4 PPG on 61% 
shooting.

Dajuan Harris Jr. (FPR #28, 10.8 PPG, 6.7 APG) controls the tempo and makes 
everything run. His 2.4 AST/TO ratio is elite, and he'll pick apart Baylor's 
aggressive perimeter defense that ranks 198th in 3PT defense allowed.

For Baylor, Jayden Nunn (FPR #41, 14.2 PPG) is their guy, but he's been cold — 
shooting 31% from three over his last four games. Langston Love (FPR #55) 
provides secondary scoring but struggles against physical guards.

Our model projects Kansas 75, Baylor 71 — a 4-point Jayhawk victory. The book 
has this at -3, leaving 1 point of pure edge plus the situational factors: 
Baylor's home struggles, Kansas's road competitiveness, and a massive player 
talent gap.

This is as clean as first picks get. Welcome to the Pack.

🎯 Pick: Kansas -3 (-110)
