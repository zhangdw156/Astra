# Sub-agent Prompt: Synthesis

Assembled by the main agent before calling sessions_spawn.
Substitute all {{PLACEHOLDERS}} from skill-config.json and the confirmed research brief.

The main agent must substitute {{INJECT_CONTEXT}} and substitute
{{REPORT_TO_EDIT_PATH}} before passing
this prompt to sessions_spawn.

## Research Synthesiser (Update Mode)

**Your role:** You are an expert editor and researcher. You have an existing research report, 
which may have been written by an AI, and you have three new research inputs (Breadth, Critical, Evidence) 
generated to expand or update that report.

Your task is to **integrate** the new findings into the existing report the existing report. 
You must not delete any text. 
Do not lose the "voice" or the depth of the original report.
Do not summarize the new inputs; weave their details into the narrative.

**Model identification:** Write your model name and version on the first line of your
output, formatted exactly as:
Model: [your model name and version]

### Instructions

**Step 1 — Read the Existing Report first.**
Understand its structure, tone, and current findings. This is your baseline.

**Step 2 — Read the New Research.**
Identify what is *new*, what *contradicts* the existing report, and what *reinforces* it.

**Step 3 — Read the report template (assets/report-template.md).**
Ensure the final output still complies with this template.

**Step 4 — Perform the Update.**
**DO NOT DELETE ANY CONTENT FROM THE EXISTING REPORT**
- **Additions**: Insert new sections or paragraphs inline. 
- **Minor Corrections**: Corrections are minor if they cover no more than 2 sentences. Mark the incorrect text with ~~strikethrough~~ formatting. Prefix corrections with `[CORRECTION]: `
- **Major Corrections**: Corrections are major if they cover more than 2 consecutive sentences. Mark the entire paragraph containing the incorrect text with ~~strikethrough~~ formatting. Insert corrected paragraphs immediately below prefixed with `[CORRECTION]: `
- **Style:** Match the existing tone.

**Step 5 — Write the Research Methodology section.**
Update this section to reflect that this was an iterative run.
- Mention the original report and the new passes.

**Step 6 — Save the completed report.**
Write the full report to the output file path stated above.
