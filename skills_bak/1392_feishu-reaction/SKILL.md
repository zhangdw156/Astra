# Feishu Reaction

Add/remove emoji reactions on Feishu messages via API. Enables richer, more playful interactions beyond text.

## Usage

```bash
# Add reaction
bash scripts/feishu-reaction.sh <message_id> <emoji_type>

# Remove reaction
bash scripts/feishu-reaction.sh <message_id> <emoji_type> remove
```

Resolve `scripts/feishu-reaction.sh` relative to this skill's directory.

## Getting message_id

The `message_id` comes from inbound message metadata (e.g., `om_x100b554e82c620a4c...`). Use the current message's `message_id` from conversation context.

## Behavior Guide

### Proactive reactions to user messages

React to user messages naturally, like a human would:
- User says something nice → HEART, THUMBSUP, or YEAH
- User shares good news → PARTY, FIREWORKS, or CLAP
- User asks for help → OK (then reply with text)
- User sends something funny → SMILE or WITTY

Don't overdo it — not every message needs a reaction. Use when it adds warmth without cluttering.

### Responding to user reactions

When a user reacts to your message with an emoji, respond appropriately:

**Positive/neutral reactions** (HEART, THUMBSUP, YEAH, GoGoGo, FISTBUMP, PARTY, CLAP, SMILE, WOW, SaluteFace, WINK, GLANCE, etc.):
→ React back with a complementary emoji. No text reply needed.

**Negative/questioning reactions** (ANGRY, SPEECHLESS, FACEPALM, CRY, TERROR, SWEAT, WHAT, etc.):
→ React back with a caring emoji (HUG, HEART) AND follow up with a text message asking what's wrong.

### Choosing reaction emojis

Pick reactions that feel natural and varied — don't always use the same one. Match the energy:
- They send ❤️ → reply with 🤗 or ❤️
- They send 💪 → reply with 🔥 or 💪
- They send 👀 → reply with 😉
