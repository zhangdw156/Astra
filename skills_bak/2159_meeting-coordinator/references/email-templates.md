# Email Templates

All templates use placeholders such as:
- `[HUMAN_NAME]`
- `[COUNTERPARTY_NAME]`
- `[MEETING_TYPE]`
- `[DAY_DATE]`
- `[TIME_DISPLAY]` (example: `3:00 PM ET` or `3:00 PM ET / 12:00 PM PT`)
- `[ORIGINAL_TIME_DISPLAY]`
- `[VENUE_NAME]`
- `[FULL_ADDRESS]`
- `[SIGNATURE]`

Replace every placeholder before drafting for approval.

## Sending Rules

- Always draft first and get explicit human approval before sending.
- Always CC the human's email on outgoing scheduling messages.
- Use `--reply-to-message-id` when replying within an existing thread.
- Use `gog gmail send --body-html` for all outbound scheduling emails.
- Include explicit timezone labels in all date/time references.
- Convert backend IANA timezone values to display labels (`ET`, `CT`, `MT`, `PT`) in outward-facing emails.
- If the counterparty is in a different timezone, include both timezones in one line (example: `3:00 PM ET / 12:00 PM PT`).
- Use the signature from `SOUL.md`/`IDENTITY.md`; do not hardcode a signature.
- Keep wording concise and professional; avoid unnecessary detail.

## Notes

- Date clarity: prefer explicit dates over relative phrasing.
- Timezone clarity: use `[TIME_DISPLAY]` with standard labels (`ET`, `CT`, `MT`, `PT`).
- Dual-time clarity: if recipient timezone differs, include both (example: `3:00 PM ET / 12:00 PM PT`).
- Personalization: keep concise but adapt warmth/formality to relationship context.
- Final check before approval request: verify names, dates, timezone, venue/link, and thread context.
